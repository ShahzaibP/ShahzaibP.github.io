Hello, I am Shahzaib Paracha!

I am currently pursuing a Honours Degree as a Bachelor of Science candidate, studying Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Manitoba.

My long time interest lies in applying Mathematics and Statistics to bring about realistic inferences to the forefront, and programming has given me an outlet to fill that void.

And this site is an outlet to showcase the strides I have made in doing so.
