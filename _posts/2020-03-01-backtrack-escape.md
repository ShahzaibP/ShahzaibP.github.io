hey again!

This is one of my previous projects. This was a very fun project which I completed back in summer'18.

Here we write a basic AI that uses a Stack DS to help a mouse escape a maze, and uses a backtracking algorithm to do so. A few different algorithms can be implemented to not only streamline the process but also find the shortest way out. However our task was to backtrack our way out, and this does the job well.

This was also my very first work in C, and needless to say, I loved every bit of it.

You can take a look at the entire code [here](https://github.com/ShahzaibP/backtracking_escape).
