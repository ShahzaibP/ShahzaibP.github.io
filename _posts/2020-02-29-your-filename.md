Greetings!

A time progresses, I learn and apply more of my knowledge in my work and this is my latest piece of work. As the name suggests, what I have here is a simply a remote.

Here I use Machine Learning jn a somewhat practical setting. I use a convolutional neural network to detect hand gestures in order to control smart appliances around me.

I capture my own hand getures via my webcam, capture 1500 images per gesture for a total of 8 getures. I train the model with 12000 images, and the results come out to be very accurate.

The use cases are endless. It can help technologically-challenged seniors, people who dont have the ability to speak or to do so properly for the machine to undertand, people with accents that are not supported by the virtual asistants, people facing ome sort of disability, people with leser dexterity and people who dont have the ability to maneuver smart appliances otherwise.
