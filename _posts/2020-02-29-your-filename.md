Greetings!

A time progresses, I learn and apply more of my knowledge in my work and this is my latest piece of work. As the name suggests, what I have here is simply a remote.

Here I use Machine Learning in a somewhat practical setting. I use a convolutional neural network to detect hand gestures to control smart appliances around me.

I capture my hand gestures via my webcam, capture 1500 images per gesture for a total of 8 gestures. I train the model with 12000 images, and the results come out to be very accurate.

The use cases are endless. It can help technologically-challenged seniors, people who don't have the ability to speak or to do so properly for the machine to understand, people with accents that are not supported by the virtual assistants, people facing some sort of disability, people with lesser dexterity and people who don't have the ability to maneuver smart appliances otherwise.


P.S. The image you see is what the computer sees, just in numbers.
