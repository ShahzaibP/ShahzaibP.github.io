## Hello, I am Shahzaib Paracha!

I am currently pursuing a Joint Honours Degree as a Bachelor of Science candidate, studying Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Manitoba.

My long time interest lies in applying Mathematics and Statistics to bring about realistic inferences to the forefront, and programming has given me an outlet to fill that void. I enjoy putting a visual touch on every piece of code I write.
And this site is an outlet to showcase the strides I have made in doing so.

Free time calls to read non-fiction, watch UFC on saturday nights, drive out to a lake or simply code.

You may click on the Projects tab on the top right to look at some of my work.

Grew up in Karachi, Pakistan and moved to Winnipeg, Canada during my teens. Been here since.
